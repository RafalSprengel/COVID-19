## General Info
A website that allows you to check the number of people infected with COVID-19 in a given country. It is possible to compare the number of infected people in different countries in the table. The idea for the website was born when I could not find a comparison tool on the Internet that allowed me to compare the number of infected people in different countries over a period of several months. The website uses an external API. I couldn't run it on GitHub Pages because GitHub blocks data from external APIs. Unfinished page.
